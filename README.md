# Learning Swift for the First Time?

Learning Swift 4 for the first time? Do you come from Not sure where to start? Clone this repo and open the playground in Xcode. This project contains code samples if you want to get your hands dirty immediately by jumping into code.

I personally started learning Swift 4 myself recently in Jan 2018. Coming from a Java/PHP/.NET background, I've always shied myself from iOS programming, because of the daunting Objective-C language.

For those of you who are coming from other languages and wants to learn Swift, I highly suggest download the free iBooks from Apple and go through each of the examples there, opening up iBooks and try to use the Xcode playground in order to learn Swift better.

This is how I would do it:

This flow helps me tremendously in learning Swift. Also check out several great free courses from Udacity: [https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ios-app-development-with-swift--ud585](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ios-app-development-with-swift--ud585)

Hopefully this helps someone, somewhere.
